# Leaflet – Mapping Earthquakes with JS and APIs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

The following tasks to complete:
•	use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. 
•	Then add the data to a map.

Approach:
•	To use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
•	Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
•	Register for a Mapbox account and get an API key (access token).

## Resources and Tools
1.	Leaflet.js
2.	D3.json 
3.	Mapbox
4.	Web browser: Google or FireFox
5.	Command line interface
